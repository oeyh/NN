# Machine Learning Basics

## Objective
Turn Andrew's Machine Learning Class assignment code from Matlab to Python (Jupyter) to practice my Python, get used to use Github and learn the basics of Machine Learning

## Time
3 month (July to September 2018)

## Plan
1. First month: Gather knowledge and practice the tools needed for this project: ML course material, Matlab, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Github, Matlab Python API*, etc. Complete at least one assignment code conversion.
2. 2nd month: Complete more assignments if not all of them
3. 3rd month: Following month 2's work, debug, make improvements on both code and presentation in Notebook. Wrap up project, summarize lessons-learned, plan for next. 

## Updated Plan (8/16/2018)
1. The past 1st month: completed 2-3 assignments,looks like with Python libraries like numpy, scipy and sklearn, no need to write Matlab Python APIs. All codes can be completed in Python and presented in Jupyter Notebook
1. This 2nd month (August): Complete all assignments
2. 3rd month: solve issues found previously, make improvements on both code and presentation in Notebook. Wrap up project with a summary report that summarizes lessons learned and the plan for next.

## Requirements
1. Basic: most codes are in Python, with some complicated optimization functions in Matlab.
2. Better: most codes are in Jupyter Notebook and ready to present, with some complicated optimization functions in Matlab.
3. Ideal: all things are presented in Jupyter Notebook, with optimization functions rewritten in Python

## Updated Requirements (8/16/2018)
1. All things are written in Python and presented in Jupyter Notebook (utilize Python libraries)
