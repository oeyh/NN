# Machine Learning Basics

## Objective
Complete Andrew's Machine Learning Class assignment/projects code in Python (Jupyter), get used to use Github and learn the basics of Machine Learning

## Plan
1. Gather knowledge and practice the tools needed for this project; Complete at least one assignment.
2. Complete more assignments if not all of them
3. Following 2's work, debug, make improvements on both code and presentation in Notebook. Wrap up project, summarize lessons-learned, plan for next. 

## Updated Plan (8/16/2018)
1. Completed: completed 2-3 assignments,looks like with Python libraries like numpy, scipy and sklearn, no need to write Matlab Python APIs. All codes can be completed in Python and presented in Jupyter Notebook
1. Ongoing (August): Complete all assignments
2. Next: solve issues found previously, make improvements on both code and presentation in Notebook. Wrap up project with a summary report that summarizes lessons learned and the plan for next.

## Requirements
1. Basic: most codes are in Python, with some complicated optimization functions in Matlab.
2. Better: most codes are in Jupyter Notebook and ready to present, with some complicated optimization functions in Matlab.
3. Ideal: all things are presented in Jupyter Notebook, with optimization functions rewritten in Python

## Updated Requirements (8/16/2018)
1. All things are written in Python and presented in Jupyter Notebook (utilize Python libraries)
