# NN

## Objective 
Turn Andrew's Machine Learning Class assignment code from Matlab to Python (Jupyter) to practice my Python and get used to use Github.

## Time 
3 month (July to September 2018)

## Plan
1. First month: Gather knowledge and practice the tools needed for this project: ML course material, Matlab, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Github, Matlab Python API*, etc. Complete at least one assignment code conversion.
2. 2nd month: Complete more assignments if not all of them
3. 3rd month: Following month 2's work, debug, make improvements on both code and presentation in Notebook. Wrap up project, summarize lessons-learned, plan for next.

## Requirements
1. Basic: most codes are in Python, with some complicated optimization functions in Matlab.
2. Better: most codes are in Jupyter Notebook and ready to present, with some complicated optimization functions in Matlab.
3. Ideal: all things are presented in Jupyter Notebook, with optimization functions rewritten in Python
